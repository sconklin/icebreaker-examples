This repository contains examples for the iCEBreaker FPGA educational and development board.

The goal of this repository is to provide simple examples that can serve as a starting point for the explaration of the iCEBreaker ecosystem. All examples are using the Yosys/Arachne-pnr/icestorm open source flow for ICE40 FPGA. No need for any signups and large downloads of proprietary toolchains necessary.

For installation instructions of the icestorm flow follow the instructons on the [icestorm website](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/#install).

The default Placement Constraint File (.pcf) for iCEBreaker can be found in the toplevel directory and contains references to all the default pins on the iCEBreaker development board. This file can be referenced by all the examples that use that board.
