This is an example design for driving the 3b and 12b HDMI PMOD modules from
 Black Mesa Labs. The design drives 800x600 video with a 40 MHz input clock.
 The actual video is an alternating display of:
   1) Color Test Pattern bars.
   2) Bouncing dot with changing colors ( Pong'ish ).
   3) Moving lines.

Original design targets Xilinx Spartan3 FPGA and makes use of 2 Xilinx specific
 primitive:
  1) BUFG    : Global Clock Tree buffer
  2) FDDRCPE : "ODDR" output flop for mirroring internal clock tree outside.

top.v        : top level for FPGA design.
vga_core.v   : Generates color test pattern, bouncing ball and moving lines.
vga_timing.v : Generates low level VGA timing for 800x600 with 40 MHz clock.
