Using memory blocks on ICEBreaker

Datasheet:

* Up to 1024 kb Single Port SRAM (SPRAM)
* Up to 120 kb sysMEM Embedded Block RAM (EBR) (four blocks)

Each EBR block is 4Kbits 256 words deep by 16 bits

Character ROM
128 characters for ASCII
256 for a full set

7x9 pixels for "old school"
so, 9 bytes

9 x 256 = 2304 Bytes

Each line 9 character + 3 spacing = 12 lines

480/12 = 40 lines
